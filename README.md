# General learning & language-learning practices

## Deliberate Practice
### Process of learning
  * ID a specific subset
  * Focus on performance in that subset
  * Get feedback
  * Update 

### Motivations
  * Project
  * Teaching deadline
### Pitfalls
  * Don't read book cover to cover without coding along the way.
  
## How to choose a language
  * Consider companies you'd like to work for & find out the languages they use
  * Consider the language(s) you know & whether you want to learn something similar or completely different; consider the following:
    * high-, mid- & low-level languages (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3468068/low-mid-high-level-language-whats-the-difference)
    * static v. dynamic type (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) 
    * strongly v. weakly (or loosely) typed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2351190/static-dynamic-vs-strong-weak)
    * imperative v. structured v. procedural v. functional v. event-driven v. object-oriented v. declarative v. automated-based (nice comparison chart: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms)
     
## Where to start with a new programming language
  * Docs
  * Books
  * Stack Overflow
  * Practice! (exercisms, codewars, etc.)
  * Find Online communities
