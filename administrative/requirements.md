## Things to consider 
1. Content
  a. Update/Add articles, videos, etc
  b. Change the questions that you want students to consider or respond to during the session
2. Session Flow
  a. Start with a discussion instead of reading
  b. Send reading ahead of time to add more discussion time
3. Grouping
  a. Consider how you group students (pairs, 3s, groups of 4)
  b. Are there certain questions that should be individual instead of whole group?
  c. Do you want to have a whole group discussion instead of smaller ones?
4. Inclusion
  a. Consider working styles and how you could help support people across the spectrum (introverts appreciate more individual thinking time, extroverts love jumping in and talking)
  b. Consider how to include all voices in the discussion.  Do you want students to have different roles?  Do you want to randomly cold call?
